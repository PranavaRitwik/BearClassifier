Binder needs requirements.txt for imports

Below command are helpful if getting Posix error for paths in Windows
#import pathlib
#temp = pathlib.PosixPath
#pathlib.PosixPath = pathlib.WindowsPath

You might have to use this instead of from commands without all
from fastai.vision.all import *
from fastai.vision.widgets import *

If Voila is not working then use this : 
pip install voila-gridstack

Binder put all import commands in requirements.txt
